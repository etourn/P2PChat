Once you have completed your implementation, review and respond to the questions below. Each of your responses should be at least four sentences.

----- Question 1 -----

What kinds of faults can your peer-to-peer chat implementation tolerate? Faults may include problems with machines or the network, as well as program crashes. 
Be specific about what failure situations you could tolerate, and explain how the system can continue to work in the face of these failures.

---- Response ----
- Our implementation handle individual peer disconnections due to a peer process crash or a peer force-quits. If a peer became unstable, our program, specifically the broascast() function, will dectect the failed write and remove the peer from the global list. Through this the rest of the chat network keeps functioning normally and only the dead peer stops receiving messages.
- Furthermore, we handle the duplicate braodcast loops by using the seen set. If the same message shows up again due to re-broadcasting loops or peers rejoining, peer_read_thread will detect the message ID and not re-broadcast. 


---- Question 2 ----

What faults will cause your peer-to-peer chat to fail, or to operate in some diminished capacity? Again, be specific about the situations that will result in failure.

---- Response ----
- We hard coded the capacity to 1000, so the if the user or network sends more than 1000 messages, the new IDs cannot be stored, which lead the system to collapse. Furthermore, if more than 1000 peers connect, the network becomes partitioned and those peer will never join the chat. 
- We keeps seen[], peers[], and message counter in memory, so if the program crashes or restrats, it will lose access to those information. Consequently, it will re-broadcases message incorrectly and the network structure is broken. 


---- Question 3 ----

One mechanism for tolerating failure is replication. If each client connected to two existing peers instead of just one, would that help you tolerate any additional faults? What problems could this change create for your implementation?

---- Response ----
Yes. It will reduce the chance of becoming isolated. A peer can survive after losing one peer connection or temporary network issue, as it's still connected to another peer. However, our message loop won't be compatible with such structure. Currently, each peer are connected like a directed graph; thus, if every node connects to two peers, duplicate detection will break and messages will be rebroadcast. Furthermore, it will also increase CPU load, as doubling peers means doubling threads, so nodes with many peers may slow down or drop connection.   


---- Question 4 ----

Describe one additional change you could make to the peer-to-peer chat system that would allow it to tolerate faults. Describe how you would implement this change, and at least one example of how it would allow you to tolerate a fault.
